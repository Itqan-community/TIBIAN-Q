## Executive Summary

ITQAN Community operates on a **smart orchestration engine** that automates workflows, assigns tasks, and tracks deliverables across a distributed network of partners and community members. This acquisition plan focuses on scaling our partner ecosystem to handle content creation, development, community management, and marketing automation—freeing our internal orchestration team to focus on management and coordination rather than execution.

**Current State**: 1 agency/partner in each category
**Goal**: Scale to 3-5 high-quality partners per category within 12 months
**Model**: Partners handle execution; internal team orchestrates and manages
